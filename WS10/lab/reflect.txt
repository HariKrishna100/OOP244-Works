This workshop on function templates have helped me practice the concepts of templates
the most important part you need to know while implimenting a template if the type of
parameter changes of what you need for example if your doing a sum template you could have 
double and int and you can use templates to solve the repitative code as the compiler will
create a template of the types thats being used so if in your main you call int it will create
a template for int in this workshop we had an array of data thats overloaded to create diffrent 
objects car, student and employee and while implimenting the search template we need to retrive the 
array by diffrent types to retrive string, int and double values of the objects it was so amazing to
have just one boolean template to search for the value asked for and displaying it and it simply finished
the lab after an hour of analysis of how the modules work, the power of templates is so great for more efficeint
coding practices
