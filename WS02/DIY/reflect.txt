from this workshop i have learnt a lot and put in place practice to dynamically
allocate memory even though its was really had to fix up the memory leak errors
this helped me to effectively debug code and try diffrent ways to make a fix but
i would thank Fardad as he gave us more time to try and fix the memory leak 
problems i had been bad in reading files and through this workshops i have been
practicing and getting better the part 2 was challenging too as we had to 
implement the code and fuctions to accomplish the task overally the tasks are easy
but hard at the same time as things go wrong and take time to solve.
